This class provides an in-depth introduction to the philosophical
problems surrounding death.  It takes its starting point in the fact
that everyone, eventually, will die.  This is one of the few facts that
human beings can be absolutely sure about.  Given this certainty,
however, death still presents us with many difficult and pressing
questions. What does it mean to die in the first place?  Who or what is
the “person” that dies?  Is it merely a physical body, or is it also
something like a soul, and, if so, does the existence of a soul indicate
that there is some hope of immortality?  Moreover, what should our
attitude toward death be?  Should we think of it as a good thing or a
bad thing?  And what effect should it have on the way we live our
lives?  At some point in our lives, we all grapple with these
questions.  This course uses the doctrines and arguments of a number of
prominent philosophers concerning death as a means to investigate these
and other questions.  The course is organized around the lectures of
Shelly Kagan, Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, who develops
his own philosophy of death over the length of the course.  Its major
purpose, aside from familiarizing you with the writings of major
philosophers on the subject of death, is to teach you *how* to think
about death philosophically—to decide for yourself what you believe
about death and to provide careful and convincing arguments for those
beliefs. This course is divided into three long units.  The first unit
covers metaphysical questions about death, i.e., questions about what
death is, what persons are, and the existence of the soul.  This unit
includes material about the positions of dualism and physicalism,
various arguments for the existence of the soul, as well as a close
reading of Plato’s *Phaedo*, one of the most influential arguments for
immortality.  The second unit deals with questions about how we ought to
value death. * We will address the views that personal identity is
rooted in the soul, in the body, and in the “personality” (understood as
a cluster of psychological properties).  We will also consider the
possibility that death has little or nothing to do with the death of the
“person,” but can be accounted for in purely physical terms.  We will
conclude the unit with a look at Leo Tolstoy’s novella* *The Death of
Ivan Ilyich.*  In the third unit, we cover topics such as the (alleged)
badness of death, how the fact that we will die should influence the way
we live, and whether it is ever appropriate to bring about our own death
prematurely.  We will consult with several important contemporary
philosophers, as well as with the great Renaissance essayist Michel de
Montaigne, the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume, and the late
existentialist Walter Kaufmann.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Discuss the philosophical issues connected with death: what it is,
    whether it is good or bad, and its significance in terms of the way
    we choose to live.
-   Explain the inter-relatedness of questions about death and questions
    about personal identity and the “self.”
-   Differentiate between dualist and physicalist conceptions of death
    and specify the particular consequences of each approach.
-   Describe the multiplicity of cultural, religious, and philosophical
    views about death and the soul.
-   Discuss major philosophical arguments for and against the
    immortality of the soul.
-   Articulate major theories of personal identity, and provide reasoned
    criticisms of these major theories of personal identity.
-   Explain and evaluate the view of death presented in literary works
    such as Leo Tolstoy’s *The Death of Ivan Ilyich.*
-   Discuss in a philosophical way certain value-theoretic questions
    about death: whether it is inherently good or bad, whether it
    presents us with obligations to live our lives in a certain way, and
    whether it is permissible to end life prematurely.
-   Describe the existentialist view of death and the notion that it
    gives life meaning by restricting its shape and scope; explain the
    various ways in which this limiting feature of death has been
    interpreted.

### Course Information

Welcome to *Philosophy 201: The Philosophy of Death*.  Below, please
find general information on this course and its requirements.

**Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a wide range of free
online materials.  However, the following course content is most heavily
relied on:

-   Shelly Kagan, Death (Yale University: Open Yale Courses),
    [http://oyc.yale.edu](http://oyc.yale.edu/) (Accessed November 11,
    2010).  License: [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA

    Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/)
-   The University of Tennessee, Martin: [Internet Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each of the three units and all of its
assigned materials.  You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the readings and web media for each unit.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.

Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If
you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **50
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 17 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 5 hours) over two days, for example by completing 1.1.1, 1.1.2,
and part of 1.1.3 (about 2.5 hours) on Monday night; completing the
remainder of 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and 1.1.5 on Tuesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** Finally, you will find it useful to use the
following “Philosophy: Glossary of Technical Terms” throughout this
course.

Terms”
