**Unit 3: The Value of Death** <span id="3"></span> 
*Whether or not we really understand what death is, there remains the
question of what our attitude toward it should be.  Most people tend to
regard death as a bad thing, and their emotional attitude toward it is
usually sadness, anxiety or fear.  But do we really have good reasons
for thinking that death, in and of itself, is bad?  Perhaps it is only
the aspects of life* leading up to *death that are dreadful.  Would we
be better off if we never died, but just went on living forever?  In
this unit, we will cover three closely related topics: the (alleged)
badness of death, how the fact that we will die should influence the way
we live, and whether it is ever appropriate to bring about our own death
prematurely, by committing suicide.  We will consult with several
important contemporary philosophers, as well as with the great
Renaissance essayist Michel de Montaigne, the Enlightenment philosopher
David Hume, and the late existentialist Walter Kaufmann.*

    article on whether or not goodness and badness can reasonably be
    applied to death.  In this article, Professor Feldman asks whether
    value terms can be appropriately applied to death.  For instance,
    pricking oneself with a pin is bad, because it introduces pain into
    one’s life.  But death seems to present a special case.  Since death
    is, by definition, not part of life, how can it possibly be bad?

    means that we are being deprived of the good things in life.  This
    means that there is nothing inherently bad about death itself. 
    Rather, death is bad only in contrast to the goodness of life.  This
    line of reasoning raises some difficult questions, however.  Is the
    badness of death the same as the badness of nonexistence?  And if
    death is bad because it deprives us of the goodness of life, exactly
    *when* is it bad?

     Instructions: Read this essay by Michel de Montaigne responding to
    various reasons why people are afraid of death.  You will need to
    scroll down about one third of the page to find the right essay. In
    this essay, the late sixteenth century French philosopher Michel de
    Montaigne argues that all of the reasons people have for being
    afraid of death are the result of the way it is understood during
    life, and that there is nothing intrinsically bad about death
    itself.  The title of the essay comes from a quotation by Cicero; it
    refers to the idea that philosophy can help prepare us for death and
    alleviate our fears of it because, when we philosophize, we practice
    disengaging from worldly concerns.

    various problems with the deprivation account of the badness of
    death, touching upon the views of several contemporary
    philosophers.  Can death be considered bad when the person it has
    happened to does not exist?  And if death is bad because it means
    being deprived of the good things in life, should we also say that
    the state of affairs prior to birth is bad?  Perhaps it is a mistake
    to derive the value of death by comparing it with life.  What if the
    real “opposite” of death is not life as we know it, but eternal
    life?

     Instructions: Read this chapter from Jonathan Swift’s *Gulliver’s
    Travels* satirizing a society of immortal beings.  In this chapter
    from Jonathan Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels*, the traveler, Gulliver,
    is told about a society of immortals.  Gulliver is jealous, thinking
    that immortality would furnish innumerable advantages.  He is
    shocked to learn, however, that the immortals (called Struldbrugs)
    are a bored and dissatisfied lot who spend their days lamenting the
    fact that they cannot die.  Swift’s tale helps us to imagine life
    without the possibility of death, and makes a case for the goodness
    of death.

    asks whether it would be desirable to live forever.  If we were
    immortal, we could eventually do everything we want to do.  But by
    the same token, we would eventually *have already done* everything
    we wanted to do.  Are there any activities we would enjoy doing for
    all eternity?  If not, perhaps immortality would turn out to be
    tremendously tedious.  Then again, what if we could devise a way to
    experience pure pleasure for all eternity?

     Instructions: Read this selection about the effect that death has
    on the meaningfulness and value of human life.  Walter Kaufmann was
    a German-American philosopher responsible for popularizing the
    existentialist philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger,
    and Jean Paul Sartre during the mid twentieth century.  According to
    Kaufmann, life is valuable *because* of—not in spite of—death, and
    the most valuable lives are those that are lived in vivid awareness
    of death’s approach.  This text is accessible through Taimar Khan’s

    left off with the question of whether life would be worth living if
    we knew that it was not real—that is, if we knew that we were simply
    hooked up to a kind of *Matrix*-like “experience machine.”  In this
    lecture, he adds a number of additional considerations.  If life is
    like a container for good and bad experiences, should the container
    itself be considered valuable in the final calculation?  What about
    the order of the experiences?  Is a “rags-to-riches” life better
    than a “riches-to-rags” life, even if they both contain the same
    amount of good and bad experiences?

    bad, including its inevitability, its ubiquity, and its
    unpredictability.  He also raises two interesting questions about
    how our knowledge of death should influence the way we life.  First,
    should we allow that knowledge to influence the way we live at all? 
    And second, knowing that thinking about death affects the way we
    live, should we make a constant effort to recognize it, or should we
    try to think about it as little as possible?

     Instructions: Read this essay surveying a number of existentialist
    thoughts on death.  In this reflective essay, Kaufmann traces
    philosophical and poetical thinking about death through a range of
    thinkers.  The views that Kaufmann finds most compelling are largely
    at odds with the norm in contemporary western culture, which he
    believes has fallen into a complacency about death (i.e. most
    Westerners vaguely associate death with old age, not realizing its
    power to give meaning to every part of our lives).

     Instructions: Read Lucretius’ poem arguing that fear is an
    inappropriate response to death.  Lucretius was a follower of
    Epicurus, who lived during the first century B.C.  Through the use
    of moving poetical images, Lucretius argues that it is inappropriate
    to be afraid of death.  As the dissolution of the body and the soul,
    death is absolutely neutral; it is neither good nor bad.  If someone
    is afraid of death, Lucretius’ advice is to consider the neutrality
    of his or her nonexistence before her or she was born and to see
    that death is exactly the same condition.

    enough.  But the object of our fear, for many of us, is not death
    itself, but the process of dying—sickness, injury, and the letting
    go of the things we love in life.  To determine whether fear is an
    appropriate attitude toward death itself, Professor Kagan defines
    three conditions for fear and concludes that perhaps the most
    appropriate response to death is not fear, but gratitude for life.

    some influence on the way we live our lives.  But what exactly
    should that influence be?  Acknowledging that we shall soon return
    to dust, should we, like Schopenhauer, convince ourselves that
    becoming dust is a noble end?  Should we, like Holderlin, aim to
    achieve some lasting accomplishment before we die?  Or should we,
    like the Buddhists, greet death as liberation from human
    suffering?

    meets certain requirements, there is nothing about suicide itself
    that should be viewed as a transgression against others, ourselves,

    attempts to distinguish when, if ever, it can be considered rational
    to end one’s life prematurely.  This is fundamentally different from
    the question as to whether suicide is right or wrong.  Are there any
    circumstances in which a person would be better off dead?  What
    about terminally ill patients who suffer great physical and
    psychological pain?  Or is the question of rationalizing suicide
    itself fundamentally incoherent?

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this encyclopedia article for an understanding
    of the history of philosophical thinking about suicide and the major
    issues it raises.  Philosophical thinking about suicide has long
    been entangled with religious doctrine and popular morality.  In
    fact, it is controversial whether suicide should ever be divorced
    from such considerations.  This article provides an overview of the
    ways in which philosophical approaches to suicide have distinguished
    themselves from one another as well as a summary of the issues of
    rationality and morality they have tried to address.  This text is
    accessible through the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
    website.

    .mp3 file, or read the transcript.  The question of whether suicide
    is ever rational is complicated by the fact that death itself is
    unpredictable.  Although we have more or less complete information
    about the quality of our lives in the past and present, there
    remains the chance that our lives will improve drastically in the
    future.  How, then, could it be reasonable to bring our lives to a
    premature end?

    suicide (48 minutes).  This lecture is also accessible via Yale

    right or wrong is typically thought to depend on the general moral
    outlook to which we subscribe.  Utilitarians argue that there are
    instances in which it can be the right thing to do, such as when it
    brings an end to severe and certain suffering, and when few other
    people will be negatively impacted by the person’s death. 
    Deontologists, on the other hand, claim that human life is
    intrinsically valuable, and that suicide amounts to a failure to
    respect that value.
