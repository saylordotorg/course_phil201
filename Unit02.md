**Unit 2: Personal Identity and the Nature of Death** <span
id="2"></span> 
*What is death, exactly?  Many would say that death occurs when a person
ceases to exist.  If this is true, then in order to understand death we
first need to understand what a person is.  In this unit, we will
consider three theories of personal identity—that is, three theories
about what makes a person “the same person” from one day to the next. 
Specifically, we will address the views that personal identity is rooted
in the soul, in the body, and in the “personality” (understood as a
cluster of psychological properties).  We will also consider the
possibility that death has little or nothing to do with the death of the
“person,” but can be accounted for in purely physical terms.  We will
conclude the unit with a look at Leo Tolstoy’s novella* The Death of
Ivan Ilyich.  *Tolstoy’s book raises a number of questions about death
that are usually identified with “existentialist” schools of thought,
e.g., How do people ordinarily think about death?  Do people really
believe they are going to die?  Is it true that everybody dies alone? 
How do our attitudes toward the fact of death affect the meaningfulness
of our lives? *

    the end of a person by theorizing about personal identity.

     Instructions: Read this summary of John Perry’s book about personal
    identity and the possibility of immortality.  This reading is a
    brief summary of the arguments developed by John Perry in his
    *Dialogue*.  The premise of Perry’s work is that a terminally ill
    patient, Gretchen Weirob, challenges her friends Sam Miller and Dave
    Cohen to prove to her that surviving death is at least a conceivable
    possibility.  Perry approaches the problem of immortality by
    examining what it means to be the same person from one day to the
    next.  The key to deciding whether we might survive death must be
    found in whatever it is that makes us our personal identity
    continuous in time.

    can a person survive his or her own death?  In order to answer this
    question, we must first understand what it means to survive *at
    all*, during the ordinary course of life.  “I have survived since
    yesterday” implies that the same person—me—has continued to exist
    since across time.  Clearly, this happens to everyone every day. 
    But what makes it possible?  In this lecture, Professor Kagan
    considers the argument that it is the soul that accounts for
    personal identity across time.

    solving it.  This article provides a general overview of the problem

    the fact that someone maintains the same identity as a person across
    time.  The article covers a number of possibilities, including
    psychological and somatic approaches.  Although the terminology in
    this article is sometimes very different from the language Professor
    Kagan uses in his video lectures (“Somatic Theory” = “Body Theory”
    and “Psychological Theory” = “Personality Theory”), the substance of
    the positions discussed is the same.

    the same person from one moment to the next is for him or her to
    have the same body.  This seems like a plausible view of identity
    for someone who does not believe in souls.  Would it be possible to
    survive death if one is simply identified with one’s body?  In this
    lecture, Professor Kagan considers this question and explores the
    possibility of “bodily resurrection,” where the recombination of a
    body’s original atoms and molecules results in a person’s returning
    to life.

     Instructions: Read this chapter from Locke’s *Essay* about the
    nature of personal identity.  In this 1690 text, John Locke
    introduced what is now called the “personality theory” of personal
    identity, according to which a person is said to have the same
    identity as long as he or she has the same consciousness, i.e., the
    same thoughts, memories, desires and so on.  Before he gets around
    to giving us his account of personal identity, though, Locke reasons
    through what it means for various other types of things to be
    identical, such as plants and animals.

     Instructions: Read this encyclopedia article explaining Locke’s
    theory of personal identity.  Locke’s theory has been widely
    influential because it solves a basic problem about personal
    identity: the question of what makes the identity of persons
    different from the identity of simpler physical things, like atoms? 
    Since the material that makes up the body is constantly being
    replaced, any purely physical explanation of personal identity—such
    as the body theory—cannot be true.  This is why Locke introduces a
    psychological explanation for the persistence of personal identity
    through time.

    one’s identity across time is a plausible and intuitive view.  In
    this lecture, however, Professor Kagan challenges us to test our
    intuitions about this view.  Does personality provide a complete
    explanation of personal identity?  What if, for example, one’s
    personality was “transferred” to another body?  What if it were
    placed in multiple bodies?  Who would be the real you?

    settles on what seems to be a satisfactory, revised version of the
    personality theory of personal identity.  His theory depends on what
    he terms the “no-branching rule,” which means that personality can
    account for personal identity as long as there is no “splitting” or
    copying of the personality into different bodies.  Professor Kagan
    then refocuses the discussion on a new question: instead of asking
    “What are the conditions for surviving death?”, we should ask: “What
    matters in surviving death?”  In other words, what is it we want
    when we want to survive death?

    means knowledge of when death has occurred and when it has not.  In
    this article, Professor DeGrazia discusses a number of possibilities
    for determining the moment of death, mostly cast in terms of
    biological functioning.  The fact that each view is problematic also
    prompts him to consider other views, such as the idea that death is
    a “cluster concept,” rather than a neat and simple condition.

    transcript.  Having decided that the personality theory of personal
    identity is the correct one, Professor Kagan argues that what really
    matters about death does not ultimately have so much to do with
    personality in a technical sense.  In other words, it is more
    important that the person who survives death be *like* me, than that
    he *be* me.  Although this sounds strange at first, the rationale is
    that although an extremely old version of oneself might technically
    be the inheritor of one’s personality, it will have been so greatly
    transformed that it no longer resembles the original person.

     Instructions: Read all chapters of this novella by Leo Tolstoy to
    learn about what becomes of our lives when we fail to acknowledge
    the fact of our death.  Tolstoy’s 1886 novella is a realistic
    portrait of a man who, because of a fatal accident, is forced to
    confront his own impending death.  The fact that Ivan will die is
    both inescapable and, somehow, unbelievable.  The unwavering
    necessity of his death finally leads Ivan to reevaluate the way he
    has lived his life and to realize that death is a death sentence, so
    to speak, only so long as we are able to avoid coming to terms with
    it.

    settles on a physicalist definition of death in terms of a person’s
    “P-functioning,” or the sum of physical and biological processes
    that gives rise to conscious personality.  On its own, however,
    P-functioning does not furnish a sufficient definition of death,
    since we have to make exceptions for people who are asleep or in
    comas.  This leads to a discussion of one important question that is
    raised by Tolstoy’s novella: Do people really believe they are going
    to die?

     Instructions: Read this article for a detailed overview of
    existentialism.  Existentialism was an influential movement in
    philosophy from the late nineteenth to the mid twentieth centuries. 
    It shifted the focus away from questions about the nature of reality
    and knowledge to questions about the meaning of life and existence. 
    The concept of death took on greater significance for existential
    philosophers, who sought to understand how human beings really
    understand the reality of their own deaths.  For most
    existentialists, recognizing that we will die is an essential part
    of living “authentically.”
