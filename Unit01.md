**Unit 1: The Metaphysics of Death** <span id="1"></span> 
*There are two ways we can begin to think about the nature of death. 
One way is to suppose that human beings are composed of a body and a
soul. This is known as a dualist view.  If we possess a soul, then we
can imagine that while the body dies, the soul may continue to exist in
some fashion.  Of course, having a soul is no guarantee that this is
true, but it does appear to be a necessary condition for surviving the
death of the body.  The other way we can think about death is to start
out with the assumption that there is no such thing as the soul.  This
view, known as physicalism, asserts that human beings are entirely
physical or that they depend so completely on their physical bodies
that, once the body dies, there is nothing to sustain our
consciousnesses (or our “selves”).  In this unit, we will attempt to
determine which of these views is the most plausible.  We will consider
a wide range of arguments for and against the existence of the soul, as
well as arguments for and against the idea that the soul is immortal. 
In order to answer these questions, we will consider a number of related
topics, such as whether we can really imagine existing without a body,
the nature of near-death experiences, and whether computers can have
free will.  We will also become intimately acquainted with Plato’s
arguments for the immorality of the soul in his dialogue,* Phaedo*.*

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
    
-   Describe the philosophical questions that surround the inevitable
    biological event of death.
-   Compare the philosophical notion of mind/body dualism with the idea
    of physicalism and how these doctrines imply different attitudes
    about death.

     Instructions: Read this article for a general outline of the
    dualist view of what a person is.  Dualism is the view that persons
    are composed of both a body and a soul.  Depending on the discussion
    at hand, terms like “consciousness” or “mind” may be substituted for
    “soul,” and “physical substance” (or “material”) for “body.”   For
    instance, one might think that whether we have a soul in addition to
    a body depends on whether consciousness is just a property of the
    brain, or whether it is something “extra.”

     Instructions: Read this article for a general outline of the
    physicalist view of what a person is. Physicalism is the doctrine
    that everything in the universe, including persons, is wholly made
    up of only one “type of stuff”—namely, physical material.  As such,
    it is a special version of monism, a metaphysical view which has
    just as interesting and elaborate a history as does dualism.  If
    physicalism is true, then there can be no possibility of human
    beings surviving the death of their bodies.  If the soul, or
    consciousness, or whatever you might call the part of us that does
    the experiencing, is wholly dependent on the physical body, then it
    will disappear as soon as the body dies.

    tries to get clear on the question “Could I survive the death of my
    body?”  To do so he introduces several possibilities including
    dualism, (the view that souls and bodies both exist, alongside one
    another), physicalism (the view that the only things that exist are
    physical), and idealism (the view that the only things that exist
    are “mental”), and outlines the major consequences of each view for
    the question of the soul’s survival.

    soul is understood in many different philosophical, cultural, and
    religious traditions, but focuses on Christian notions of the soul. 
    Also, notice the Hindu inclinations towards mind/body dualism and
    the ancient Greek conflation of “soul” with “mind,” as well as
    “being alive.”  When we ask the question, “Does the soul survive the
    death of the body?”, can we be sure that we all understand that
    question in the same way?  Is there perhaps a common “minimal”
    conception of the soul?

    number of ways that one might go about arguing for the existence of
    the soul.  He starts with the idea that the soul is something we
    cannot, strictly speaking, see.  But scientists prove the existence
    of things we cannot see all the time—things like gravity, atoms, and
    germs.  Perhaps we can agree that souls exist because we “need” them
    in order to explain other facts about the activity of bodies.  On
    the other hand, maybe everything about the soul can be explained in
    physical terms—just like smiles can (arguably) be explained purely
    by reference to the physical parts of the mouth.

    provides an overview of the various positions that philosophers have
    adopted on the question of free will.  As we will see in the next
    lecture, free will is the basis for one argument for the existence
    of the soul.  But do we have free will?  Or might our actions be
    determined by external forces?  And are these two basic options even
    mutually exclusive?

    his line of reasoning from about “best explanation” arguments for
    the existence of the soul.  The hypothesis is that the possession of
    a soul is what sets human beings apart from physical objects, even
    really sophisticated ones like chess-playing computers.  But why
    should we think that a person is fundamentally different from a
    computer?  One answer is that, unlike computers, human beings have
    free will.

    for Survival? Parapsychology and Near-Death Experiences”) about the
    question of whether human beings, in whatever form, might survive
    death.   This article introduces the idea that reports of near-death
    experiences might supply evidence of an afterlife (and, by
    extension, a soul).  Experts are divided on just how such evidence
    should be interpreted.  A great number of people report having
    near-death experiences, and there is a certain amount of coherence
    among their accounts, but variations in detail, as well as
    comparisons with other related experiences, suggest that such
    reports do not furnish evidence of an afterlife.

    Kagan considers near-death experiences as evidence for the existence
    of the soul.  One way to defuse the idea that near-death experiences
    provide such evidence is to offer alternative explanations for them,
    i.e., physicalist explanations.  And while convincing physicalist
    explanations may not be forthcoming, they cannot be ruled out as
    possible explanations any more than the dualist explanation can.

     Instructions: Read the front matter and sections 4 (“The Mind”) and
    7 (“Mind-Body Relation”) of this encyclopedia article about
    Descartes.  Descartes argued, in essence, that the mind and body
    must be two distinct things, because it is so easy to imagine the
    mind existing without the body.  In fact, according to Descartes, if
    we limit ourselves only to our most basic and unshakeable beliefs,
    we will see that we identify ourselves purely with our minds and the
    activity of thinking—and not at all with the body.  This argument
    has been extremely influential because of its first-person
    formulation: anyone can try out the experiment and decide whether he
    or she thinks Descartes is right.

    dramatizes his mentor Socrates’ final day of life, during which he
    speaks with several of his friends about death and the nature of the
    soul.  Plato relates, through Socrates, a number of arguments for
    the soul’s immortality, and presents these as reasons why the
    philosopher should be cheerful in the face of death, and not
    disappointed or afraid.

     Instructions: Watch this video lecture about Plato’s theory of
    forms and how it lends support to the idea of an immortal soul (47
    minutes).  This lecture is also accessible via Yale University’s
    Open Yale Course website at: [Philosophy of Death with Professor

    video link that is appropriate for your Internet connection to
    launch the video.  You can also hear the lecture as an .mp3 file, or
    read the transcript.  Plato’s first argument for the immortality of
    the soul is an extension of his general theory of forms.  Plato
    argues, basically, that human beings have two kinds of knowledge:
    knowledge of the sensible world, which we get through our sense
    organs (i.e., our bodies), and knowledge of the forms, which we get
    through our souls.  Because the souls are “more like” the forms than
    our bodies are, our souls must also be unchanging and eternal. 
    Professor Kagan also discusses Plato’s related “argument from
    recollection,” in which he lays out his curious theory of memory and
    reincarnation.  If the soul existed before we were born, would that
    fact not strongly suggest that it will exist after we die?

     Instructions: Read sections 1-3 of this encyclopedia article about
    how the ancient Greeks conceived of the soul.  This article provides
    some helpful background knowledge about the idea of the soul that
    Plato inherited from Greek culture, as well as an overview of the
    idea of the soul as it appears in his dialogues *Phaedo*and
    *Republic*.  Some of his ideas, such as reincarnation and the idea
    that knowledge is recollection, are rooted in Plato’s culture, while
    other aspects of his view, such as the soul’s relation to the forms,
    are wholly his own.

    simplicity” for the immortality of the soul (50 minutes).  This

    must be possible to break that “something” into parts.  According to
    Plato, the soul has no parts<s>—</s> and therefore cannot be
    destroyed.  In this lecture, Professor Kagan considers this argument
    for the soul’s immortality, as well as a number of convincing
    counter-arguments.  Should we believe that invisible things cannot
    be destroyed?  How would we know?  Simmias’ analogy of the soul with
    a harmony is raised as a counterexample.

     Instructions: Watch this video lecture about Plato’s “argument from
    essential properties” for the immortality of the soul (50 minutes).
     This lecture is also accessible via Yale University’s Open Yale
    Course website at: [Philosophy of Death with Professor
    Kagan](http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/death/) (Adobe Flash and
    Quicktime).  Alternatively, you may select the Flash or Quicktime
    video link that is appropriate for your Internet connection to
    launch the video.  You can also hear the lecture as an .mp3 file, or
    read the transcript.  In this lecture, Professor Kagan considers
    Plato’s final argument for the immortality of the soul.  Plato
    argues that being alive is an essential property of the soul, like
    being physical is an essential property of a pencil.  That is, if it
    is not physical, it is not a pencil, and similarly, if it is not
    alive, it is not a soul.  Professor Kagan concludes that since none
    of the arguments for the soul have been convincing, we must now
    attempt to confront death from a physicalist point of view
